                                 # Image Classification Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) Project




To perform image classification using CNNs, you can follow these steps:

Data Preparation: Organize your image dataset into train, test, and validation sets. Ensure that the images are labeled properly.

Model Building: Construct a CNN model using TensorFlow/Keras. Define the architecture of the model, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. Compile the model with an appropriate optimizer and loss function.

Training: Train the model on the training data using the fit method. Monitor the training process to ensure that the model is learning effectively.

Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model on the validation set to assess its performance. Check metrics such as accuracy and loss to gauge how well the model generalizes to unseen data.

Prediction: Use the trained model to make predictions on new images. Load the model, preprocess the input image, and use the predict method to obtain predictions.

Visualization: Visualize the predictions and their corresponding probabilities. Plot bar charts or display the images with predicted labels and probabilities.

Saving the Model: After training, save the trained model to disk for future use. You can use the save method in TensorFlow/Keras to save the model in HDF5 format.

Deployment: Deploy the trained model for inference in real-world applications. You can integrate the model into web applications using frameworks like Streamlit or Flask.
